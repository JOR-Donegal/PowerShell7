## Testing
Despite the warning, PowerShell created the folder C:\Temp and the file HelloWorld.txt To verify, run the command 
```
Get-Content C:\Temp\HelloWorld.txt
```
To check the DSC Configuration Store, run the command 
```
Get-DscConfiguration
```
## Remove the Configuration
To delete the configuration and stop using it, use the commands as shown below.
```
$Session = New-CimSession -ComputerName "localhost"
Remove-DscConfigurationDocument -Stage Current -CimSession $Session
```
After running this successfully, check the DSC Configuration Store again, it should be clear.

# Finally
We could use a timer to push this configuration or we could have a repository of MOF files on a file server and we could get the servers to pull configurations. We can use an SMB share or web services; web ports tend to be more flexible in a large environment. We really need a certificate authority (CA) set up or we need a self-signed certificate to use this over the web.
