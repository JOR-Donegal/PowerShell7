# Background 

We can install features very easily in Windows Server by using Power Shell. The command 
```
Get-WindowsFeature
```
returns a list of available roles and features. 

The command  
```
Install-WindowsFeature
```
installs the required role or feature and 
```
Uninstall-WindowsFeature 
```
removes a feature.

However, maintaining a server can be more of a challenge, ensuring it is always in the correct state. Doing so for a fleet of servers is another problem again! 

These notes are provided to introduce you to __Desired State Configuration__ (DSC) in Windows Server. __Managed Object Format__ (MOF) is the language used to describe __Common Information Model__ (CIM) classes; we need to compile MOF files for using with DSC.

To do these exercises, you will need access to some Windows VMs. 
If you are completing this on Azure Labs, you need a VM with Hyper-V.

If you are working on campus, or using a home machine with VMWare Workstation, you should be able to complete these exercises.

# Desired State Configuration
Setting up a server is one thing, keeping it with that configuration is another. Desired State Configuration (DSC) is a set of Power Shell features that allows us to configure and maintain a configuration of Windows Server 2019, to make sure every server is in the desired state. We could do this with scripts on a timed job, but this is a good way to automate this process as well. 
Using DSC, we can
- Install and remove server roles and features
- Create registry settings
- Create files and folders and manage directories
- Start and stop processes
- Manage groups and users
- Run other PowerShell scripts 

Most importantly, we can examine a server to see if it is in its desired state and if not, fix it! There are a range of built-in providers in DSC that enable this functionality.

Note that one of the providers is called File, I can use this to automatically copy an important file to any server. 
Also notice the provider WindowsFeature. To see which features I can add, I can use the command  

```
Get-WindowsFeature
```
I am not going to show the output, it scrolls off the page!
