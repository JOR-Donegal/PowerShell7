# Tests

I wonder how many modules are available from the PS Gallery? I created __5. FindModules.ps1__ and it took a while to run!

How many of these modules support PSCore? I created __6. FindModulesPSCore.ps1__

The command 

```
get-module -ListAvailable
```

will give you some idea of the total modules available to you.

# Finally
Now you have run
- PowerShell 5.1 using the terminal and ISE
- PowerShell 7.x using the terminal and VSCode 

This is a starting point! 

In these notes I told you to save to C:\PowerShell, now save your scripts to your OneDrive. 
Set up a GitHub repo called PowerShell and make your C:\PowerShell folder a Git repo. 
Sync your scripts up to GitHub and verify they are there. This will be graded at the end of the module.
