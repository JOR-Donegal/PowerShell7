# PowerShell Gallery

As with most code platforms these days, there is a repo! The PowerShell Gallery is this repo and you can download modules using PowerShellGet.  To work with this gallery, you need some underlying tools and _Nuget_ is the package manager for .Net. 

I have started adding comments!

I can run a selection by pressing the button indicated in Fig 4.

I install nuget, and install a module PowerShellGet.

```
Install-PackageProvider Nuget -MinimumVersion 2.8.5.201 -Force | Out-Null
Install-Module -Name PowerShellGet -Force -AllowClobber
mkdir c:\PowerShell
```
