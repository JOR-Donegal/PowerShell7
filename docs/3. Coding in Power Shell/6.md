# Loops
Whenever code needs to be executed many times, we use loops.
Almost any code I write to provide a service will run in an endless loop until I hit [ctrl][c].
I presume you understand break (which exists the loop) and continue (which goes to the next cycle of the loop) and I will not explain them here.

## For loop

The for loop has the syntax: 
```
for (<Init>; <Condition>; <Repeat>)
{
    <Statement list>
}
```
__Init__ is a command before the loop begins, for example 
```
$counter=0 A 
```
A Condition resolves to __true__ or __false__ and determines whether the loop runs. 

__Repeat__ executes every time the loop runs.

As a simple example...
```
for ($counter = 0; $counter -lt 10; $counter++)
{
    $counter
}
```
## ForEach

We can iterate through an array using foreach.
```
$MyArray = "J", "o", "h", "n"
foreach ($Letter in $MyArray)
{
    $Letter
}
```
## While
While loops can have a simple format.
```
while($val -ne 3)
{
    $val++
    Write-Host $val
}
```
Some while loops are a little more complicated. This is a simple menu example from 4sysops.com. It takes user input and carries out actions depending on the user input.
```
while(($inp = Read-Host -Prompt "Select a command") -ne "Q"){
    switch($inp){
       L {"File will be deleted"}
       A {"File will be displayed"}
       R {"File will be write protected"}
       Q {"End"}
       default {"Invalid entry"}
       }
    }
```
## Do Until

A do until loop is very similar to while.
```
$a = 0 
do
{
    “Starting Loop $a”
    $a
    $a++
    “Now `$a is $a”
} until ($a -ge 5)
```
