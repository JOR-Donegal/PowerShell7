# Conditional Branching

In informal terms, Conditional Branching occurs in a computer programme when based on a value, the programme jumps to a particular set of instructions. Its fundamental, you can find it in higher-level languages, but also down at the processor level in op-codes.

Tests
In most programming languages, we have the conditions, these are Equality Operators.

- gt greater than
- igt greater than, case-insensitive
- cgt greater than, case-sensitive
- ge greater than or equal
- ige greater than or equal, case-insensitive
- cge greater than or equal, case-sensitive
- lt less than
- ilt less than, case-insensitive
- clt less than, case-sensitive
- le less than or equal
- ile less than or equal, case-insensitive
- cle less than or equal, case-sensitive

## if and elseif
The first conditional statement we will consider is the if statement. This is also one of the oldest statements used in high level languages.
Try this, vary one of the values.
```
$Variable1 = 32
$Variable2 = 32
if ( $Variable1 -ne $Variable2  )
{
    Write-Output "The condition was true"
}
```
We can also use __elseif__.
```
$day = 3

if ( $day -eq 0 ) { $result = 'Sunday'        }
elseif ( $day -eq 1 ) { $result = 'Monday'    }
elseif ( $day -eq 2 ) { $result = 'Tuesday'   }
elseif ( $day -eq 3 ) { $result = 'Wednesday' }
elseif ( $day -eq 4 ) { $result = 'Thursday'  }
elseif ( $day -eq 5 ) { $result = 'Friday'    }
elseif ( $day -eq 6 ) { $result = 'Saturday'  }

$result
```
Read this [reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/learn/deep-dives/everything-about-if?view=powershell-7.4).
Create some examples using __-like__. My example finds a depth sounder in a standard NMEA0183 serial stream.
```
$FINDVALUE = '$SDDPT,2.98,,*66'
if ( $FINDVALUE -like '$SD*')
{
    Write-Output "Found a depth sounder"
}
```
## Switch
I have based these notes on [this reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/learn/deep-dives/everything-about-switch?view=powershell-7.4). 
Any C programmers will start being at home now! In the previous session we used if and elseif to select a day, here I use switch.
```
$day = 4

switch ( $day )
{
    0 { $result = 'Sunday'    }
    1 { $result = 'Monday'    }
    2 { $result = 'Tuesday'   }
    3 { $result = 'Wednesday' }
    4 { $result = 'Thursday'  }
    5 { $result = 'Friday'    }
    6 { $result = 'Saturday'  }
}

$result
```
