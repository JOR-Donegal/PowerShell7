# Types
I have based these notes on this [reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/lang-spec/chapter-04?view=powershell-7.4). 
Characters and strings have the usual functions available, review the options at the reference provided.
```
$StringValue = "Yoo hoo!"
$StringValue.ToUpper()
$StringValue.ToLower()
```
You should be familiar with the concept of an array and iterating through it. When iterating, the first value is [0].
```
$MyArray = 1,2,3,4,5
$MyArray[1]
```
Rather than a single Integer type, we have int for 32-bit numbers and long for 64-bit numbers. These are signed, so an int can store +/- 2^31^ values, the first bit denotes positive or negative. A long can store +/- 2^63^ values. There is also a value for byte.
