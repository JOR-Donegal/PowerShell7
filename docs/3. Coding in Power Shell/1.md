# Introduction 

PowerShell is just another programming language. In previous notes I have covered the basics of any procedural language. You can expect to find variables, types, loops and all the other normal facets of a programming language.

At the end of the last section, you had C:\PowerShell synch'd with a GitHub repo. You also had a backup copy of your scripts on your OneDrive. Continue to save the work in this section in each of these locations.

When you sync your scripts up to GitHub verify they are there. This will be graded at the end of the module.
